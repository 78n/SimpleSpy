# SimpleSpy V3

SimpleSpy V3 is a penetration testing tool designed to intercept [remote calls](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Remote-Functions-and-Events) from the client to the server.

SimpleSpy V3 is designed to be the "default" remote spy and built with minimal bloat, performance, and reliability in mind. You can find SimpleSpy V3 in places such as [Infinite Yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield)

## Status
SimpleSpy V3 is discontinued as I no longer have moved onto new projects and no longer exploit. I will attempt to keep the legacy code from breaking but other than that unless I get some miraculous motivation to make it for studio or something this is discontinued indefinitely. Thank you for all the support over the years.

## Features
- View remotes fired
- Functioninfo spy
- Simple user interface
- Continuous support
- Included Remote-to-Script for arguments
- Improved stability and performance over alternatives

## Script
To use SimpleSpy V3, just run the following code (or copy the code from SimplySpy.lua) into a supported executor.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/78n/SimpleSpy/main/SimpleSpyBeta.lua"))()
```
