Rewrite Update:
    I'm about like 50ish% done (I'm working on the hooking stuff right now)
    Rewrite will have return logging for RemoteFunctions among other things
    stay tune

Hello my people to anyone that actually still uses Simple Spy Ive decided to start working on it again
I've already fixed the biggest issue I had with simple spy... The syntax highligher
As it is right now I can format the full Infinite Yield source in about 0.06~ seconds (roughly 450000~ characters)
I'll likely make the default character limit about 100000 characters for the syntax and allow the user to configure their syntax to their preferance

Along with that I'll start working on my userdata serializer again to hopefully make the output better and faster
and last I'll be working towards adding Parrellel Lua support (Actors)
TLDR:
    Simple Spy V3 is being worked on again
