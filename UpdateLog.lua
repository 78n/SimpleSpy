Update Logs:
Fixed a bug where if you disabled function info it would make simple spy semi unusable until you renabled it (sorry)
Changed any FindService to GetService because apparently there is a detection for FindService
Fixed erroring when function info is enabled and you have a second version of simple spy running (more for personal reasons but it's a fix none the less)
