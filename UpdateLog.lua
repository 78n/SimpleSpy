Update Logs:
Fixed script's not generating fired index style
if your executor does not support hookmetamethod SimpleSpy will only log remotes fired index style
Now unhooks hookmetamethod
Added Log metamethod by default it is set to false (useful when hooking remotes)
Made the source look slightly cleaner :O
