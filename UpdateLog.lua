Rewrite Progress:
  Progress is going good.
  I have finished the syntax highlighter 
  (fixed a bug with having to serialize "<" due to it breaking richtext)
  If you're interested here's a preview: https://youtu.be/CsLdVkpT29M

Simple Spy Update:
  also fixed an issue with simple spy due to the new roblox menu
  the new menu changed the UI offset and the current simplespy source 
  didn't automatically account for this
  TLDR wally bothered me so I fixed an issue
