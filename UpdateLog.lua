Update:
Updated the beta link with the newest current version of simple spy
no longer do you have to use weak tables it now has deepclone
I havent tested this much due to the whole byfron situation
so dont expect it to be very table
next update I'll maybe try and add return value logging finally

Beta link:
https://github.com/78n/SimpleSpy/blob/main/SimpleSpyBeta.lua

todo:
add return value logging
rewrite highlight system (soon:tm:)
table cloning (instead of weak tables)
rewrite instance to string function (kinda scuffed right now)
