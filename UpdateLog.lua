Update Logs:
Finally updated this
I've still got a lot to add but overall this should now work in a majority of games
added callback stuff along with getconnections
fixed a lot of detections
fixed function info being disabled if a C closed function was passed
I cut a lot of support because I kind of needed to add set thread identity
and a lot of other stuff
