I've been rather busy lately but I've basically finished the syntax highlighter I just need to optimize it more
other than that Im basically just waiting on electron

Even more progress:
I've taken a short break on coding to focus on other projects
Im now doing this entire project as a pation project so theres no garentee
that I'll even finish this
but... I have finished the Seralizer
up next is to finish the syntax highlighter (this will likely be the last time i rewrite it)
progress isn't going too bad but dont expect much

More progress:
  I have finished the Serializer
  I am now going to rewrite syntax highlighter
  so that is faster (I wrote it in string interpolation which is very slow)

Rewrite Progress:
  Progress is going good.
  I have finished the syntax highlighter 
  (fixed a bug with having to serialize "<" due to it breaking richtext)

Simple Spy Update:
  also fixed an issue with simple spy due to the new roblox menu
  the new menu changed the UI offset and the current simplespy source 
  didn't automatically account for this
  TLDR wally bothered me so I fixed an issue
