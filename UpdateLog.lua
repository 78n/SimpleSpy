More progress:
  I have finished the Serializer
  I am now going to rewrite syntax highlighter
  so that is faster (I wrote it in string interpolation which is very slow)

Rewrite Progress:
  Progress is going good.
  I have finished the syntax highlighter 
  (fixed a bug with having to serialize "<" due to it breaking richtext)

Simple Spy Update:
  also fixed an issue with simple spy due to the new roblox menu
  the new menu changed the UI offset and the current simplespy source 
  didn't automatically account for this
  TLDR wally bothered me so I fixed an issue
